[images]
; * url_base: get thumbnail images from this source. If not
;    defined, will default to the local version, but that
;    means you will need to download >100,000 thumbnail images
;    onto your machine. If you want to use the images on the
;    OneZoom server, set this to `//images.onezoom.org/`
url_base = //images.onezoom.org/

[sponsorship]
; * allow_sponsorship. Should we allow the sponsorship page to be
;    shown on this machine (0 or 1)? Usually not allowed, except on the
;    main OneZoom site (on museum displays people will not want
;    to enter paypal etc details). If set to anything other than 0/1 or all/none
;    this is assumed to be a "role", such as manager, and only
;    people logged in with the role can sponsor (for testing purposes)
; * maintenance_mins: to enable maintenance mode (e.g. when 
;    switching beta and production to enable a new website version)
;    set to the number of minutes you expect the site to be down
;    note that if is_testing=False then you will probably need to 
;    restart the server for changes to this to take effect
; * reservation_time_limit_mins: how long to reserve a leaf while a 
;    user is looking at the sponsor page
; * unpaid_time_limit_mins: how long before a sponsored leaf becomes 
;    free again if we receive no payment notification
; * hmac_key: A secret key used to generate signatures for links in renewal e-mails
;    to prove users used a link from an e-mail we sent.
