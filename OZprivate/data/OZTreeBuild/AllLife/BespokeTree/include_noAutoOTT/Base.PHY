== EUKARYOTES ==

The position of various basal Eukaryote groups is often debated. This tree is based on the diagram from "The New Tree of Eukaryotes" by Fabien Burki and colleagues (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2019.08.008). 


The main controversy is the placement of the Eukaryotic root. The debate tends to involve the "Excavates", now comprising Discoba, Metamonada, and Malawimonada ( https://doi.org/10.1111/jeu.12691). For example, according to this preprint: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.08.438903,  Discoba) may be sister to the main two eukaryoric groups Diaphoretickes+Hemimastigophora and Amorphea+CRuMs. On the other hand, Derelle (2015, EUBAC tree) follow the "Bikont" classification places Discoba as sister to Diaphoretickes+Hemimastigophora. Until this is resolved, here we simply use the OpenTree definition of Excavata (ott2927065) and roughly following Derelle, set it as sister to Diaphoretickes+Hemimastigophora, but with a branch length of 0, so that it appears as a polytomy.

((Excavata,(Diaphoretickes,Hemimastigophora))Bikonta:0,(Amorphea,CRuMs)Podiata)

Note that currently Hemimastigophora (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-018-0708-8) is not properly represented in OpenTree, so we need to create it by hand (genera are Hemimastix, Spironema, Paramastix and Stereonema, grouped into Hemimastigida (ott5273711)

Hemimastix (ott7510361) and Spironema (ott4038752) are currently (OT 13.4) in microsporidia, while Paramastix (ott4801700 with 4 descendant spp) is and Stereonema geiseri is missing completely, so we should have

The basal eukaryotic divergence is set to 2150MYA from Strassert et al (2021, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-22044-z), with the Amorphea/CRuMs divergence at set to 2000MYA (more recent than the Ancyromonad divergence at ~2100MYA)

== "ARCHAEA" ==

For Archaeal paraphyly, see https://doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evu031 (Fig 2b, Fig 3). The position of the Eukaryotes within Archaea is very variable. Here I basically go with Fig 3 (the eocyte hypothesis), but to highlight to controversy I give the RV points number 39a, 39b, 39c. See also the recent review at https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-micro-040921-050212

The archaeal groups are taken from OpenTree v5 which has a largely reasonable arrangement based on https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0062510 and https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms3304 (PhyloPhlAn). I used the 'TACK' group arrangement (Thaumarchaeota, Crenarchaeota, Korarchaeota, 'Aigarchaeota': https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tim.2011.09.002 ) which in OT5 has

(Crenarchaeota_ott114216,Thermococci_ott921413),(Thaumarchaeota_ott102415,Thermoplasmata_ott921398) 

NB Aigarchaeota comes under Thaumarchaeota in the OTT. To make the tacK part, I also add Korarchaeota_ott266344

(((Crenarchaeota_ott114216, Thermococci_ott921413),(Thaumarchaeota_ott102415,Thermoplasmata_ott921398)),Korarchaeota_ott266344)

The Asgard group of archaea should probably be sister to Eukaryotes

Asgard-group_ott7000000

dPANN from https://doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evu031 , consisting of

(((Nanoarchaeota_ott678209@,*Diapherotrites_ott5205266@),(*Aenigmarchaeota_ott4795972@,**Nanohaloarchaeota_ott5351807@)),(**Micrarchaeum_ott5248238@,Parvarchaeum_ott4796454@))

Where taxa marked * are missing from synth tree 9.1-10.4, and can be added from 8,
Micrarchaeum is listed as 'Miscellaneous Euryarchaeotic Group(MEG) ott5248238', and
Nanohaloarchaeota is simply Nanosalina (ott296712) +Haloredivivus (ott186386) + Nanosalinarum (*ott296715)


Parvarchaeum_ott4796454 in 9.1 is nested within Halobacteria (and we can also remove its parent, Deep Sea Hydrothermal Vent Gp 6: ott5248234

That leaves Euryarchaeota as the remaining Archaea minus the rest (including Nanosalina ott296712 and Haloredivivus ott186386, which are separately in the Nanohaloarchaeota). We also remove ott7001595 "Ancient Archeal Group" and ott7001595 "TACK group Archaeon" which not only are not individual
species but are also currently not sensibly placed.

Euryarchaeota_ott635958~996421-7000000-114216-921413-102415-266344-678209-5205266-4795972-4796454-5248234-5248238-296712-186386-296715-5246115-7001595

(Note that the groups marked with * are also included in this removal, so this will generate a few
(ignorable) warnings about "Could not find subtree _ottXXXX within tree XXX/996421.nwk"

TAK groups form Thaumarchaeota and Aigarchaeota (Aigarchaeota comes under Thaumarchaeota in the OTT). In OpenTree v5 this is sister to Thermoplasmata_ott921398). We add Korarchaeota as the sister to this, then 
TACK is this clade plus the sister group Crenarchaeota. Thermococci_ott921413 is wrongly placed as sister to Korarchaeota+Crenarchaeota+Nanoarchaeota, so we remove them
from TACK which leaves them in the Euryarchaeota, as per a recent review (https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-micro-040921-050212)

Very rough dates of Archeal evolution from Betts et al (2018; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41559-018-0644-x), with  Asgardarchaeota diverging at 2700 MYA, Crenarchaeota etc at 2800, and other spaced ~ 200MYA apart

== Eubacteria ==

We have little bacterial expertise, and the rooting of the Eubacteria may be problematic, so we simply take the standard OpenTree phylogeny, removing a few taxa such as "Apis mellifera" (ott 5900566) and "Capra hircus" (ott 5251869) which are clearly misleadingly named.
