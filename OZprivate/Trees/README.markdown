## Readme

This folder is for convenience and stores all the static site elements that we want to be accessible from www.onezoom.org/trees

In the longer term we might adopt another solution here

We should not use a - in any URLs here as it'll cause problems later as we move into having a separate controller for trees.

They should all be copied into /home/web2py/trees/ on the server completely separately from the main OneZoom
