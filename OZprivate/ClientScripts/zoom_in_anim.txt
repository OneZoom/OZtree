Recording the JS code (which can be put into the JS console of the live browser) for a zooming animation to be screencasted.

onezoom.controller.fly_on_tree_to(1,-887526,false,0.25)

This will zoom into humans (or change the 887526 to the OZID of any leaf)
The 0.25 will give animation speed 1/4 of the default speed.
