              <a href = "{{=URL('linnean')}}">Linnean Society Tree</a> released. This has all the same species as our original complete tree of life, highlights popular places associated with Carl Linnaeus and we have plans for further improvements in future.  The money raised from sponsorship of leaves on this tree will be shared with the Linnean Society of London (further details when you try to sponsor).  We can provide customised trees like this as free service for other charitable organisations whose aims are similar to our own: please ask for further details.

              <h4>20th May 2018</h4>
              
              The OneZoom tree of life explorer version 3.2 released.... it features an all new user interface to the tree, publicly available source code under a OneZoom non-profit source available license, and a documented framework enabling others to easily design a complete OneZoom tree into their website or public display without needing to touch the core software. A lot has changed behind the scenes as well including use of a new testing framework to put new releases through their paces before we make them live on our main site.

              This lecture will tell the story of the tree of life and how modern technology has overcome the challenge of turning it into something tangible that anyone can explore. Along the way, we will journey into some of the more obscure areas of the tree, meet some of the extraordinary organisms that dwell there, and learn how they came to evolve.

              OneZoom version 3.1 released with new updates including better performance on touch screen devices and basic multi-language support on the tree.

              <h4>January 2017</h4>
              OneZoom received a certificate of commendation from the UK National Co-ordinating Centre for Public Engagement after having been long-listed for their 2016 Engage Awards. The judges described OneZoom as "An ambitious and complex project, which has been tackled well, producing a useful and impactful resource."

              <h4>October 14th 2016</h4>
              
              New updates to the OneZoom software went live today. We now have improved pages that allow you to browse and sponsor a species of your choice from any particular group, such as <a href="{{=URL('sponsor_node?n=8&ott=244265')}}">Mammals</a>, or any common ancestor in the tree. We've made some other behind the scenes improvements too. OneZoom now relies less on third party web services and includes fail-safes that ensure better data accuracy.

        <p>As with version 2.0, the tree and its contents are continually updated with the recent scientific information.</p>
        <p>A really big thank you to everyone who <a href="{{=URL('sponsored')}}">sponsored a leaf of the tree</a>, your donations made this possible. There are loads of great leaves on the tree <a href="{{=URL('sponsor')}}">still available to sponsor</a>, please consider helping us make OneZoom even better.</p>

              <p>A version of OneZoom for genealogy is launched today at <a href="http://www.zoompast.org" target="_blank">ZoomPast.org</a>. This is a new and unique way to visualize and share genealogies in the same way as you can explore the tree of life with OneZoom. You can explore example genealogies of famous and fictional characters including Darwin, British Royalty and various US presidents, or build your own genealogy and share it with family and friends.</p>

              The OneZoom concept has led to another application: you can now build your own family tree and explore the family trees of famous people in a OneZoom inspired way at <a href="http://www.zoompast.org" target="_blank">ZoomPast.org</a> - currently in beta testing.

              New work published today by James Rosindell and Laura Nunes from the OneZoom team, together with Sam Turvey from the Zoological Society of London ranks bird species in priority order for conservation based on their evolutinoary distinctiveness and the economic costs of protecting them. See a OneZoom visualisation of the results <a href="{{=URL('ADEPD_birds_nunes_etal_2015.htm')}}" target="_blank">here</a>. The brown colored branches link to 206 threatened species that were evaluated, which are coloured in red. Zoom into any leaf to see where that species ranks and why.

      <p>A <a href="{{=URL('plants.html')}}">new tree</a> with over 31,000 species of seed plant is now available on OneZoom. We worked with the authors of the new tree data to release this at the same time as their research unveiling the tree was published in Nature (See Zanne et al. Nature. doi:10.1038/nature12872. - 2013). The colouring of this tree indicates whether each plant is wood, herbaceous or variable.</p>

      <h4>October 13th 2013</h4>
      <p>Independent reseach conducted by academics at Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology ranked OneZoom as the fourth most memorable visualisation image out of those tested. The researchers conducted an extensive study of over 2000 visualisations, they conclude that "quantifying memorability is a general metric of the utility of information, an essential step towards determining how to design effective visualizations". The publication titled <a href="http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&q=What+Makes+a+Visualization+Memorable%3F&btnG&as_sdt=1%2C5&as_sdtp" target="_blank">"What Makes a Visualization Memorable?"</a> was published by the IEEE Computer Society.</p>

          <h3>OneZoom Project Foundation in 2011</h3>
          
          <div class="col-md-4">

          <p><q>Big data</q> is a growing issue in Science and Industry.  Modern computing has enabled large amounts of data to be captured and stored and has revolutionised many branches of science. These advances, however, lead to challenges, such as how to explore and visualise large data sets.  The very first blue-skies idea that could have been identified with OneZoom was that of a mind map so vast that it could contain all human knowledge.</p>
          
          <a href="{{=URL('static','images/gallery/bubble_example.png')}}" target = "_blank" class="thumbnail">
              <img src="{{=URL('static','images/gallery/bubble_example_small.png')}}" alt="">
          </a>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-4">
          <p>The concept involved making the information easy to explore by laying it out in ever smaller bubbles using a fractal structure and a zooming interface so that the computer never runs out of space to put the information no matter how much there is. </p>
          
          <p>The idea was untouched for some time until one day, <a href="http://www.rosindell.org" target="_blank">James Rosindell</a> visited Charles Darwin's Down house with <a href="http://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/~lukeh/" target="_blank">Luke Harmon</a> who he was working with on a number of scientific projects.  Luke in particular made a big deal of their walking down Darwin's thinking path and said that they should try to think of a new idea to commemorate the occasion.</p>
          
          <p><a href="{{=URL('static','images/gallery/James_Luke.jpeg')}}" target = "_blank" class="thumbnail">
              <img src="{{=URL('static','images/gallery/James_Luke_small.jpeg')}}" alt="">
          </a></p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-4">
          <p>The photo shows James (left) and Luke (right) in front of Down house, taken just after their lap of the thinking path.  It is unfortunate that none of the ideas they discussed whilst actually on the thinking path have led anywhere yet, but it was less than two hours later when wandering around central London that the topic of tree visualisation came up and James suggested a possible way to visualise the tree of life based on an adaptation of his fractal mind map idea.</p>
          
          <p>James initially worked on coding OneZoom only during his spare time, taking advice from Luke in particular, but also from many others. After that, James further developed OneZoom as part of his research program at <a href="http://www3.imperial.ac.uk" target="_blank">Imperial College London</a>, which is funded by a research fellowship from the <a href="http://www.nerc.ac.uk" target="_blank">Natural Environment Research Council</a> (NERC).</p>
