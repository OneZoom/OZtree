<h3>Leaf sponsorship</h3>

<img class="lft_edge" src="{{=URL('static','images/leaves/Lpic2.png')}}" />

<p>We’d be delighted if you would consider sponsoring a leaf on the OneZoom Tree of Life. OneZoom is a registered UK charity, and the funds we raise allow us to maintain and improve this tree of life explorer as a resource for everyone. Note that sponsorship text is publically visible on the tree so must be appropriate for this, and also that we aim to keep our scientific information as up to date as possible, which may affect some aspects of your sponsored leaf in the future. We have written the guidelines below to make you aware of how we will manage this; we hope you will find them fair. When sponsoring a leaf on the tree, you must also agree to our data protection and privacy policy, our cookie policy and our general terms of website use.</p>
</div>

<div class="uk-grid-small uk-text-small uk-child-width-1-2@m " uk-grid>
<div class = "uk-padding uk-padding-remove-top">

<h4>Acceptable sponsorship text</h4>

<ol>

<li>Please use no offensive or inappropriate language.</li>
<li>Sponsoring for another person is a gift. It should not be in order to cause them distress e.g. "Sponsored for my ex. partner, even more of a blood sucking parasite!"</li>
<li>If you choose the 'sponsor by' text option, you must put your own name in the text field.</li>
<li>If you put another person’s personal information into the sponsorship form it is your responsibility to check with them that they are happy with this before entering the data.</li>
<li>Web links and text that appears like an advertisement are not permitted.</li>
<li>Any text that appears in conflict with our goal of promoting appreciation and conservation of biodiversity is not permitted (for example text that appears to promote causing harm to an animal you are sponsoring).</li>
<li>What constitutes appropriate sponsorship text is at our discretion and we reserve the right to make changes to sponsorship text, both before the text first appears publicly and at any time after initial acceptance. We do however commit to show your true name, town and country, or any combination of these that you would like.</li>
<li>You agree for your sponsorship text to appear on the OneZoom tree of life and other related resources on a royalty free and perpetual basis, subject to the terms of our data protection and privacy policy.</li>

</ol>

<h4>How your sponsored leaf text will appear</h4>

<ol>

<li>Your sponsorship text will appear on our complete tree of life explorer at {{=A('OneZoom.org/life', _href=URL('default','life', extension=False))}}, it may appear on similar resources elsewhere, but this is not guaranteed.</li>
<li>The capitalisation of your sponsorship text may not be preserved. For example "from London, UK" may appear as "FROM LONDON, UK".</li>
<li>The orientation, colour, image, position and scientific data of your sponsored leaf may change due to advances in scientific understanding or enhancements to the OneZoom software.</li>
<li>We may redesign the tree in future, but your sponsorship text will remain.</li>
<li>In addition to your text appearing on a leaf, we may also use your information as displayed on the tree to acknowledge your donations on our {{=A('donor page', _href=URL('default','donor_list', extension=False))}}.</li>

</ol>

</div>

<div class = "uk-padding uk-padding-remove-top">

<h4>What happens to revenue generated through sponsorship</h4>

<ol>

<li>The purpose of the OneZoom charity is "to advance the education of the public in the subjects of evolution, biodiversity and conservation of the variety of life on earth." Your donations (after a small PayPal fee) will be spent in pursuit of this purpose.</li>
<li>Sometimes we share donations from sponsorship in collaboration with another not for profit organisation. We only do this with organisations that have charitable aims compatible with our own. If this is the case for your donation it will be made clear on the page where you enter the details for your sponsored leaf.</li>
<li>Leaf sponsorship and donations to OneZoom support our overall efforts rather than anything specific to that leaf or the species within it. You are not donating to work relating to that particular species, nor are you getting the species named after you.</li>
<li>You are making a donation to charity, which is appropriately acknowledged, rather like having a plaque attached to the side of a building listing the donors that supported its construction. You are not purchasing advertising, or any other product. Donations will thus only be refunded in extraordinary circumstances.</li>

</ol>

<h4>Sponsorship expiry and scientific updates</h4>

<ol>
<li>All sponsored leaves have an expiry date: four years after the date when the sponsorship first became visible.</li>
<li>You will have the first refusal to continue your sponsorship of that leaf in future.</li>
<li>If your sponsorship expires and we are unable to contact you your leaf will become available for sponsorship by others.</li>
<li>The donation required for sponsorship renewal may not be the same as the amount donated for initial sponsorship and the terms and conditions for sponsorship might also be different upon renewal.</li>
<img class="rgt_edge" src="{{=URL('static','images/leaves/Rpic2.png')}}" />

<li>At any time, a leaf can only have one sponsor - get your favourite species before someone else does!</li>
<li>A tiny handful of leaves can only be sponsored through direct negotiation with OneZoom. Different conditions may apply to these leaves: for example the automatic right to re-sponsorship may not apply. Other specific changes to conditions will be discussed during negotiation.</li>
<li>If your sponsored leaf is removed from the tree for any reason (e.g. due to advances in scientific understanding) we will contact you to offer an equivalent alternative of your choice. If we are unable to contact you, we will make a choice on your behalf.</li>

</div>
<div class = "uk-padding uk-padding-remove-top">



<h4>How personal data is used and shared with others</h4>

<h5>If required by law</h5>

<p>We may disclose some or all of the information collected from you if required to do so by law or other legally binding obligation.</p>

<h5>On sponsored leaves and donor pages</h5>

<ul>

<li>Your sponsorship text, or an edited version of it, may be publicly visible on our {{=A('tree of life', _href=URL('default','life', extension=False))}} and related resources, on our {{=A('donor page', _href=URL('default','donor_list', extension=False))}}, and on other similar resources connected with OneZoom.</li>

<li>The minimum donation amount required to sponsor each leaf is public knowledge. It may therefore be possible for others to infer the approximate amount you have donated to OneZoom by looking at your sponsorships.</li>

<li>Should the text you entered be deemed inappropriate and we are unable to contact you, we will use the first and last name you have provided to us, as well as your country as sponsorship text on your leaf of the tree.</li>

<li>By keeping the “credit me on the OneZoom donor page” box checked during sponsorship, your  full name and title (which may be different from your sponsorship text) may be publicly visible on our donor page. You may appear here in a category based on the size of your donation. The same information will also be used to provide you with a bespoke donor page which is similar to our main donor page but lists only the leaves that have been sponsored by you.</li>

</ul>

<h5>Twitter and e-mail</h5>

<ul>

<li>Your twitter name will be used to tweet a public note of thanks to you when your sponsored leaf goes live on the tree.</li>

<li>Your e-mail(s) will be used to initially thank you for your sponsorship, provide you with links to your sponsored leaf, and for any communication related directly to your sponsorship.</li>

<li>If you agreed by ticking the box, we will also use your e-mail to send you occasional updates about OneZoom.</li>

</ul>

<h5>Gift aid</h5>

<p>If you agreed to gift aid, your full name, title and address will be used by us to reclaim tax on your donation from the UK government.</p>

<p>Some sponsorships also include a donation to one of our partner organisations, which is highlighted clearly on the sponsorship form you filled in in.  In such cases, if you agree to gift aid and the collaborative organisation is based in the UK and qualifies to receive payments through gift aid, then we will share your full name, title and address with the collaborative organisation, who will only be entitled to use that information for the purposes of gift aid reclaim.</p>

<h5>Quotes and endorsements</h5>

<p>We keep a record of quotes and endorsements for OneZoom.  If you have e-mailed us text that we wish to use for this purpose we will write to request your permission separately. Quotes and endorsements once agreed become visible to the public and should be considered under a creative commons attribution license.</p>

<h5>Internet Protocol address and session information</h5>

<p>This information is only used for system administration of the website and to compile statistics which we use to review use of the website.</p>

<h4>Your rights regarding your personal data stored by us</h4>

<ol>

<li>You can request a copy of any of your personal data held by us.</li>

<li>You can request corrections to any of your personal data held by us. We agree honour these requests, however, changes to your sponsorship text must still be deemed appropriate for public viewing according to our terms of leaf sponsorship.</li>

<li>You can retract your gift aid statement, or request corrections to the data associated with that.</li>

<img class="rgt_edge" src="{{=URL('static','images/leaves/Rpic3.png')}}" />

<li>You can request deletion of all your personal data, or any part of it. If you request deletion of your sponsorship data then your name will no longer appear on the tree as a sponsor, or on our donor page, and the leaf you sponsored will become available for sponsorship again.</li>

<li>If you sponsored a leaf for another person, and they request their name to be removed from the leaf, we will do so. You will then have the opportunity to choose an alternative sponsorship text for your leaf.</li>

<li>Data that has been deleted from primary use may still persist in backups.</li>

<li>You can request to alter your subscription to receiving e-mail updates from us (note that the default state is to be unsubscribed).</li>

<li>We will still e-mail unsubscribed users if something arises specific to their sponsorship, for example if their sponsorship is about to expire. To receive opt out of even these e-mails please write to request removal of your e-mail address from our database altogether. Note that this will mean you will no receive any notifications about your sponsored leaves and they will eventually expire unless you take the initiative to get back in contact with us.</li>

<li>We will not pass your e-mail address on to any third parties.</li>

<li>To make requests relating to your personal data, you must e-mail us using an e-mail address we have on file as being associated with your data, provide us with a unique reference number associated with your sponsorship, or use some other reasonable method to prove your identity so that we know it’s definitely you.</li>

<li>We cannot guarantee the confidentiality of any messages transmitted between you and us via e-mail as these are potentially accessible by the public. We will not be liable to you or anyone else for any loss in connection with any email message sent by you to us or by us to you.</li>
