            <p><a href="http://www.biologie.ens.fr/phyloeco/index.html" target="_blank">Hélène Morlon</a> is a researcher at the French national center for scientific researcher (CNRS). After training in mathematics, she obtained a master in ecology and a PhD in environmental sciences. During five years as a postdoc in the US, she developed a deep interest in biodiversity research. She currently leads an interdisciplinary team of young researchers at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Paris focused on understanding how the deep-time evolution of biodiversity led to life around us as we see it today. Hélène is a 2016 TED Fellow. Since joining the OneZoom team as an ambassador, Hélène has been working to raise awareness around OneZoom and help us form links and is also a member of the OneZoom scientific advisory panel.</p>

                    <p>Kai Zhong graduated from Imperial College London in 2013 with a distinction in computer science at masters level. His main project was an Android app for OneZoom, which was supervised by James Rosindell and Duncan Gillies. He went on to work with James Rosindell to produce <a href="http://www.zoompast.org" target="_blank">ZoomPast</a> a human family tree (Genealogy) website based on the OneZoom concept. Kai has primarily been working on upgrading the OneZoom engine to enable it to handle visualisation of the complete tree of life. Kai Zong worked as a freelance software developer on the OneZoom project in 2016 and 2017 working on the release of versions 3.0 and 3.1. Kai now works as a professional software developer in China.</p>

                            <p>Jonathan Sutton studied maths and computer science at Imperial College as an undergraduate. He has always had a passion for science communication and education. He discovered OneZoom by accident, after attending a lecture given by James on 'mathematical approaches to evolutionary trees'. Since then, he has worked with James' research group on writing code for ecological neutral models. He won a bursary from the Imperial College 'Charity Insights' scheme to work with OneZoom, and focused on improving the website's efficiency on mobile devices. Jonathan made contributions to the OneZoom version 3 codebase. Since his graduation Jonathan now works for Facebook as a professional software developer.</p>
