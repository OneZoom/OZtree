 <p> We're in alphabetical order by surname. Special thanks also to our <a href="/default/past_contributors.html"> past contributors</a></p>

 <em> Interested in joining us? Further volunteers are welcome especially those will skills in software development, user experience design, science communication, education, or charity governance. A person willing to write more tours around the tree of life would be particularly useful right now. Please get in touch if you're interested.</em>

            <p>Jared Khan is a software engineer based in the UK. Having studied Computer Science at the University of Cambridge, he went on to design and build mapping, localisation, and simulation tools at British self-driving car startup Five AI and now runs the playful UK/New Zealand maths education startup Polymath as an engineer, designer, and occasional artist & animator, helping engage 6-11 year-olds in maths topics at home and at school. He chanced upon OneZoom in 2023 and became a frequent user. His contributions to the app include high resolution rendering, search history, and smooth frame-rate animations. When he's not at a computer, he's often found rock climbing or film-making.
