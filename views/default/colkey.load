<h3>What the colours mean</h3>
<p> Under default settings, the leaf colours correspond to the risk of extinction for the species that leaf represents. Leaves corresponding to species that are "vulnerable", "endangered", or "critically endangered" according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) {{=A('Red List', _href="http://www.iucnredlist.org")}} are shown in red. These are all the species that are known to be under threat of extinction. The leaves shown in green represent species that are known to be okay for now (not under threat of extinction). These are "least concern" or "near threatened" species.</p>

<p>Most of the leaves are grey meaning that their risk of extinction is not known. This could be because the species is "not evaluated", or classified as "data deficient" by the IUCN.  It is also possible that a species with a grey leaf has been assessed by the IUCN but under a different species name that we weren't able to identify automatically.</p>

<h3>Popularity</h3>

<p> The leaf colours correspond to how popular the species is according to our {{=A('index of species popularity', _href=URL('popularity','index.html'))}}, which is calculated for every species in the tree. Popularity for a given species takes into account page length and page views for the English language Wikipedia entry of that species (if such a page exists) and also all the named groups (higher taxa to use the scientific term) containing that species.</p>

<h3>Plain green, brown</h3>

<p> A plain colour scheme with green leaves and brown branches made to look like a tree. All leaves are shown in the same way under this colour scheme and so are all branches. It's useful if you're looking for simple colour scheme e.g. for {{=A('screenshots using our screenshot tool', _href=URL('education','screenshot_launcher.html'))}}, that doesn't require any further explanation.  </p>

<h3>Ancestor's tale</h3>

<p>With a colour scheme to match the front cover of the Ancestor's Tale (2016) book by Richard Dawkins and Yan Wong.  The book uses graphics from OneZoom throughout to illustrate sections of the tree of life. All leaves are shown in the same colour under this scheme.  Pictured is how this colour scheme looks when you select 'Ancestor's Tale' as the page content in settings as well.</p>
